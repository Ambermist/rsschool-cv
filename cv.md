## 3.Summary

My principal goal is to find out, wich professional path is the best for me, whether it is to proceed working in the laboratory
as a biochemist according to my university specialization, or should I expand my knowledge of the other appealing subject - 
web and game development. So I started rs-school courses because I see them as a great opportunity to dive into varied world of IT and aquire
certain understanding of such occupations as testing, automated testing, creating code foundation for mechanisms by which 
applications and tools of different devices work. Then, eventually, in conformity with my preferences, as well as obtained along the way skills and
expierience, I'm going to find my place and job in some team of developers. This, I hope, would be valuable practice of  working on complicated project
in cooperation with other people, learning from them, discovering new ideas and making contribution myself.

## 4.Skills 

I have at least basic skills in such programming languages as java and javascript, also I have learned key aspects of HTML and CSS
from several sources, including lessons on codeacademy - (https://www.codecademy.com/users/Ambermist/achievements).
I'm familiar with version control concept and with necessary for manipulating project flow actions in git and github, with MySQL commands needed for
searching through and sorting out data bases, with common algorithms and types of data structures.

## 5.Code examples

Counts sum in Java
```Java
package samples;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class someSum {
    public static Scanner input;
    int number1;
    int number2;

    public someSum() {
        this.number1 = input.nextInt();
        this.number2 = input.nextInt();
    }

    static int sumThis(int number1, int number2) {
        return number1 + number2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = sumThis(input.nextInt(), input.nextInt());
        System.out.print(result);
    }

    static {
        input = new Scanner(System.in);
    }
}
```
``` Javascript
   function solution(str){
var splitStr = str.split ("");
var reversedArray = splitStr.reverse();
var reversedStr = reversedArray.join ("");
  return reversedStr;
}
solution("world");   
```
## 6.Expierience

Unfortunately, none worth of mentioning here, no expierience of actually working as developer... But I'm in the process of learning right now

## 7.Education

I graduated from BSU (faculty of biology, biochemistry department) in 2017. Year after I got master's degree in biology from 
Graduate School of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.
